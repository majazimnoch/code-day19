# Blobs and CSS keyframes animation

## Intro

This is the nineteenth project of my 30-day coding challenge. The project includes following tech stuff: HTML, CSS, Blobs shapes from <a href="https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/elements/simple-svg-blob-shapes/"> here </a>.

## Breaking down the code
I made a simple responsive website. I used Shapes called 'blobs' and also I changed the shape to an image and then animated this shape. I used `keframes animate`.
