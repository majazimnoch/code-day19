# Blobs and CSS keyframes animation

## Intro

This is the nineteenth project of my 30-day coding challenge. The project includes following tech stuff: HTML, CSS, Blobs shapes from <a href="https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/elements/simple-svg-blob-shapes/"> here </a>.

## Breaking down the code
I made a simple, responsive website, fully focusing on improving my styling skills. I practised adding a 'blob' to a webiste which is a shape with irregular edges. Additionally, I also worked with an image. I changed and then animated its shape. I used `keframes animate`.
